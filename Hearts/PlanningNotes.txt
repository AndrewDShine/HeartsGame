Hearts Planning Board

What objects will we need?
-A card
--Cards need suits and ranks
--Ranks are internally classed as a number, but need to be interpreted for syso-ing

-A human player
--Holds an internal ArrayList of cards as its hand
--Four get created
--Each is created with a name
--Each has an order of play, 1-4
